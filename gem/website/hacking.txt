h1. Hacking

If you want to hack on FunFX (fix bugs, add features), start by building everything and running the specs.
Go to the top level directory and open two console windows.

* Window 1 *

<pre><code>rake httpd</code></pre>

* Window 2 *

<pre><code>rake build</code></pre>

After you've worked yourself through the first couple of error messages (you'll be told to
install some additional ruby gems), you should see green output telling you that everything is ok.

Now add some more specs, hack away and let us know when you've fixed something (specs should still be green).
