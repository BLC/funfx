h1. FunFX

FunFX is a functional testing tool for Flex applications. FunFX lets you click buttons, menus, trees
and send any kind of event to any kind of element inside a swf. It also lets you retrieve values from
elements so that you can compare them with expected results.

h2. Example

The best way to show you how this works is through an example. The video below shows you the basics

h2. Try for yourself

# gem install funfx
# Save "funfx_example.rb":funfx_example.rb to your disc
# ruby path/to/funfx_example.rb

You should see the same as what you see in the movie

h2. Learning more

We recommend you learn "RSpec":http://rspec.info/, "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/ and "Cucumber":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber

These tools work great with FunFX and let you run several tests and produce nice reports about failing and passing tests.
