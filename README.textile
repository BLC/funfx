h2. Documentation

Please look under gem/website
We should put this on the GitHub wiki to make it easier to edit.

h2. TODO before 0.2.0

Code

* (P) Get rid of the AutoQuick codebase - base FunFX only on the automation API
** Must not depend on XML file at runtime

Website / Docs

* Automate gem release on RubyForge (rake release)
* Automate publish of website (rake website_upload)
* Make demo app part of website
** (A OK) git mv demo-app/lib/DemoApp.* gem/website/
** (A OK) Update scripts so specs still pass
** (P) Update howtos
** Move rest of this file to gem/website/
* (P) More demo app specs

h2. TODO after 0.2.0

* Refactor the awful duplication in Proxy.as
** Different return values for unsynched and invisible
** eval() is gone from AS3, but we can fake it... with apply and our own dotted syntax.
* Add method to get all properties of an element (useful for debugging)
* Get rid of ARG_SEP - use varargs instead.
* Use RCov and aim for 100% coverage of all generated methods
* Add method to retrieve screenshot
** http://blog.flexexamples.com/2007/11/16/taking-screenshots-in-flex-using-the-imagesnapshotcaptureimage-method/
* Allow lookup of elements from elements:
** tree = @flex.tree({:id => 'objectTree'})
** button = tree.button(:label => 'Default Button')
* Make snake_case aliases for camelCase methods (in code generation) - use camelCase in PDF
* Split PDF into 3-4 smaller PDFs
* Add method to get all properties of an element (useful for debugging)

h2. DONE

* Put the Flex app's ID in the beginning of the @flex_id
* Extract a Decoder class
* Turn off DOT in RDOC
* Generate code based on same code that we generate class diagram with (no longer use bang!)

h2. GOTCHAS

* The showInAutomationHierarchy property seems to cause that elements can't be looked up. Investigate...
