h1. FunFX

FunFX is a Ruby tool for functional testing of Flex applications.

h2. Running FunFX against the demo app

* Copy flex/src/AutoQuickEnv.xml to demo-app/lib/AutoQuickEnv.xml (This step will go away in the future)
* ruby demo-app/lib/httpd.rb (Start a little web server to serve the HTML/SWF)
* ruby gem/spec/funfx/demo_app/button_spec.rb (Run some FunFX)

h2. TODO

* Package XML file in FunFX.swc - makes it easier to install and get started...
